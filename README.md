## 📋 What It Returns

| Field          | Example                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |

| **Safety Tip** | Actionable advice for the user    |

### Example Reply

```text
🔍 CAPDETECTOR

🚨 Verdict: FAKE
📊 Confidence: 91%

📝 Reason:
This claim has been repeatedly debunked by WHO and health authorities worldwide.
The message uses classic fear-mongering language to pressure sharing.

🚩 Red Flags:
• No credible source cited
• Uses emotional manipulation ("SHARE BEFORE DELETED")
• Contains fabricated statistics
• Anonymous attribution ("doctors say...")

💡 Safety Tip:
Always verify health claims on official WHO or government health websites before forwarding.
